### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix userbase dataset, aiming to reveal insights related to subscription types, revenue patterns, and user demographics.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Netflix_Userbase.csv" file from Kaggle.com. The dataset consists of 2,500 rows with attributes such as user ID, subscription type, monthly revenue, join date, last payment date, country, age, gender, device, and plan duration.

### Tools Used

### Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data integrity by addressing inconsistencies, such as date formatting issues and missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends and patterns within the data, including user demographics, subscription preferences, and revenue distribution.
3. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the insights to facilitate understanding and decision-making.

### Steps Taken
#### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handling Null Values**: Identified and addressed any missing or incorrect data entries.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Subscription Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of different subscription types and calculated the average plan duration for each type.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Examined monthly revenue trends, including the identification of the highest and lowest revenue-generating subscription types.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Explored user demographics, including age, gender, and country, to identify key user segments.

2. Incentivize Longer Subscriptions:
  - Introduce discounts or perks for users who opt for longer subscription durations like 6-month or annual plans. This can reduce churn rates and stabilize revenue streams.
  - Implement loyalty rewards for long-term subscribers

3. Leverage Data Analytics:
  - Develop predictive models to anticipate user behavior, such as likelihood of upgrading or downgrading plans.
  - Conduct regular churn analysis to identify patterns and intervene before users decide to leave the platform.
