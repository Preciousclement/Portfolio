# Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio!


## About Me
I'm Precious Clement, a data analyst and researcher with experience in Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL. Data isn't just numbers, it's a story waiting to be told. I love transforming raw data into insights that guide smarter decisions and uncover opportunities most wouldn’t see. I’m all about finding the story within the stats and my favourite part is creating beautiful interactive dashboards because who said numbers can't be colorful. Below are a few projects that showcases my creative problem-solving and data-driven strategies.
