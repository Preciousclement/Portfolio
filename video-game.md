### Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of video game sales data across various regions, platforms, and genres. The dataset used for this analysis contains information on the global sales of video games, including attributes like the game's name, platform, release year, genre, publisher, and sales figures in different regions such as North America, Europe, Japan, and other parts of the world.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Video Game Sales Analysis - vgsales.csv" file from Kaggle.com.

### Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify trends and patterns in video game sales across different platforms and regions. By leveraging Excel for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization, the project aims to provide insights into the most successful video games, genres, and platforms, as well as regional preferences in the video gaming industry.

### Tools and Techniques Used
**1. Excel:**
  - Data Cleaning: The raw dataset was cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

**2. Tableau:**
  - Visualization: Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created to depict the distribution of sales across different regions, the performance of various genres and platforms, and the timeline of game releases.

### Analysis
It can be observed that the region that generated the highest revenue is North America because the country “United States” in this region is among the first 5 countries with the most sales in gaming. 

Between the years 1980 and 2020, 2007 had the maximum point of sales for all regions except in Europe (2009) and Japan (2006) due to the high number of games published in that year. 

2007 had the highest number of publishing, with 1473 titles, marking the seventh generation of consoles, where developers delivered games that were bigger, brasher, and more spectacular.

The top 3 most used consoles worldwide are Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

Key findings include:

1. North America is the region with the highest total sales of $4392.95. The top 5 genres for each region include:
   - **North America:** Action, Sports, Shooter, Platform, and Misc
   - **Europe:** Action, Sports, Shooter, Racing, and Misc
   - **Japan:** Role-playing, Action, Sports, Platform, and Misc
   - **Other Places:** Action, Sports, Shooter, Racing, and Misc
   - **Globally:** Action, Sports, Shooter, Role-playing, and Platform

2. Top 10 platforms with the highest number of sales:
   1. PS2
   2. X360
   3. PS3
   4. Wii
   5. DS
   6. PS
   7. NES
   8. GBA
   9. PSP
   10. PS4

3. From the year 1980 to 2020, 2007 had the highest number of sales due to the highest number of titles published.

4. The dataset corresponds with the top consoles used as per Google.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
- The top consoles are Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, and Microsoft.
- North America and Europe are the best regions to target.
- The genres Action, Sports, and Shooter are the top three to consider for maximizing audience engagement when publishing games.
- The Strategy genre should be avoided as it may not generate significant revenue for the company.
- To attract a global audience, the next versions of games should be improved to meet customer satisfaction and sales expectations.
